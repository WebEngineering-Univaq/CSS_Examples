# CSS_Examples
> Example files to test CSS3 features

This repository contains HTML files used to test and exemplify different CSS(3) features.

## Usage

This is a collection of *samples* developed during the lectures of the  [**Web Engineering course**](https://webengineering-univaq.github.io). The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 14th lecture of the course, so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*

## Installation

Just open the HTML files!
